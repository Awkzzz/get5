**Warning:** get5 is a relatively new project and things change often. Information in these docs is generally kept up to date to the lastest development builds, so releases may not contain all features described here.

This has replaced the [get5 wiki](https://github.com/splewis/get5/wiki), because it is easier for users to submit Pull Requests to, allowing all users to contribute to better documentation.
